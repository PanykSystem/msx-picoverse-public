# Change Log

## v2.27

- Bumped Explorer to v2.27.
- Raised the MSX-MUSIC/FM-PAC audio output gain to match the existing SCC, SCC+, and Dual PSG I2S volume boost while preserving sample clipping protection.

## v2.26

- Bumped Explorer to v2.26.
- Added an MSX-MUSIC audio profile to the MSX Explorer ROM detail screen for non-system, non-SCC-class ROMs.
- Ported the LoadROM YM2413/emu2413 audio engine into Explorer and added runtime FM-PAC expanded-slot handling that reads the bundled FM-PAC BIOS from the Explorer UF2 flash payload.
- Moved the Explorer ROM cache from RP2350 SRAM to PSRAM so MSX-MUSIC can coexist with the existing Explorer features without overflowing firmware RAM.
- Updated the Explorer user documentation for MSX-MUSIC profile selection, mapper restrictions, and flash-payload FM-PAC BIOS storage.
- Allowed SPACE as well as ENTER to execute a ROM from the ROM detail screen when `Action: Run` is selected.
- Changed the File Hunter ROM download flow to show `Downloading...` instead of the generic network status check message.
- Removed the WiFi setup hint and F4 special handling from the help page return prompt.
- Increased the Explorer microSD ROM size limit and PSRAM SD ROM buffer from 2 MB to 4 MB.

## v2.25

- Bumped Explorer to v2.25.
- Reworked ROM audio selection around named, mutually exclusive audio profiles so new audio chips can be added without conflicting with SCC or system ROM options.
- Added a Dual PSG audio option for non-system, non-Konami SCC/Manbow2 ROMs, using the same secondary PSG port model as LoadROM.
- Updated the Explorer and PicoVerse 2350 documentation to describe Dual PSG support, audio profile exclusivity, and mapper restrictions.
- Added the shared PicoVerse 2350 Dual PSG implementation reference covering Explorer and LoadROM behavior.
- Updated the public README with user-facing Explorer instructions for selecting the Dual PSG audio profile on supported ROMs.
