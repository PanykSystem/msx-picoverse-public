# MSX PicoVerse 2040 — Sunrise IDE Emulation for Nextor

This document describes the implementation of the Sunrise IDE interface emulation in the MSX PicoVerse 2040 firmware. The emulation allows the RP2040's USB-C port to function as a Sunrise IDE-compatible hard disk, running Nextor DOS from any USB mass storage device (flash drive, USB-to-SD adapter, etc.).

## 1. Overview

The MSX PicoVerse 2040 Sunrise IDE emulation provides a complete implementation of the Sunrise MSX IDE interface, allowing the MSX to boot Nextor DOS and access USB mass storage devices through the RP2040's USB-C port. The implementation:

- Emulates the Sunrise IDE FlashROM mapper (128 KB, 8 × 16 KB pages)
- Emulates the full ATA task-file register set
- Translates ATA sector read/write commands into USB Mass Storage Class (MSC) Bulk-Only Transport operations
- Runs the Nextor 2.1.4 Sunrise IDE driver (Master Only edition)
- Uses the RP2040's dual-core architecture for deterministic bus timing

## 2. The Original Sunrise IDE Hardware

The Sunrise IDE interface is a cartridge-based IDE controller designed for the MSX platform. It was one of the most popular mass storage solutions for MSX computers. Key characteristics:

### FlashROM

- **Size**: 128 KB organized as 8 pages × 16 KB each
- **Window**: Single 16 KB window at `0x4000`–`0x7FFF` (MSX page 1)
- **No ROM at page 2**: The `0x8000`–`0xBFFF` range is not used by the Sunrise cartridge; the MSX provides its own RAM there
- **Contains**: The Nextor (or MSX-DOS 2) kernel plus the Sunrise IDE device driver

### Control Register at 0x4104

- **Write-only** register
- **Bit 0**: IDE register enable (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled)
- **Bits 7:5**: FlashROM page number (BIT-REVERSED — see §5)
- **Bits 4:1**: Unused / reserved

### IDE Registers

When bit 0 of the control register is set (IDE enabled), the following regions are overlaid on top of the ROM in the `0x7C00`–`0x7EFF` address range:

| Address Range     | Function                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x7C00`–`0x7DFF` | 16-bit IDE data register (low/high byte latch)          |
| `0x7E00`–`0x7EFF` | ATA task-file registers (mirrored every 16 bytes)       |
| `0x7F00`–`0x7FFF` | Normal ROM data (not intercepted by IDE)                |

### ATA Interface

The Sunrise IDE implements a standard ATA (IDE) interface supporting:

- Master/Slave device selection
- PIO data transfer (no DMA)
- 28-bit LBA addressing
- Standard ATA commands (IDENTIFY DEVICE, READ SECTORS, WRITE SECTORS, etc.)

### Reference Implementation

The Carnivore2 cartridge includes a Sunrise IDE-compatible implementation in VHDL. The relevant signal for bank switching is:

```vhdl
IDEROMADDR <= cReg(5) & cReg(6) & cReg(7) & Addr(13..0)
```

This reverses bits 5, 6, and 7 of the control register to recover the actual page number — confirming the bit-reversal scheme used by the Nextor bank-switching routine (see §5).


## 3. Architecture

The Sunrise IDE emulation spans all major subsystems of the PicoVerse 2040:

## 4. Memory Map

### Full Address Space View (slot `0x4000`–`0x7FFF`)

When the PicoVerse is selected via `/SLTSL`, the following addresses in page 1 are active:

| Address Range       | IDE Disabled                | IDE Enabled                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `0x4000`–`0x4103`   | ROM (current page)          | ROM (current page)                   |
| `0x4104`            | ROM data (read) / cReg (write) | ROM data (read) / cReg (write)    |
| `0x4105`–`0x7BFF`   | ROM (current page)          | ROM (current page)                   |
| `0x7C00`–`0x7DFF`   | ROM (current page)          | **IDE 16-bit data register**         |
| `0x7E00`–`0x7EFF`   | ROM (current page)          | **IDE task-file registers**          |
| `0x7F00`–`0x7FFF`   | ROM (current page)          | ROM (current page)                   |

Note: `0x8000`–`0xBFFF` is **not** served by the PicoVerse in Sunrise mode. The MSX's own RAM mapper or other device provides this range.

### ROM Page Mapping

The 128 KB FlashROM is divided into 8 pages of 16 KB each:

| Page | ROM Offset         | Content (Nextor 2.1.4)              |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 0    | `0x00000`–`0x03FFF` | Nextor kernel bank 0                |
| 1    | `0x04000`–`0x07FFF` | Nextor kernel bank 1                |
| 2    | `0x08000`–`0x0BFFF` | Nextor kernel bank 2                |
| 3    | `0x0C000`–`0x0FFFF` | Nextor kernel bank 3                |
| 4    | `0x10000`–`0x13FFF` | Nextor kernel bank 4                |
| 5    | `0x14000`–`0x17FFF` | Nextor driver code (bank 5)         |
| 6    | `0x18000`–`0x1BFFF` | Nextor kernel bank 6                |
| 7    | `0x1C000`–`0x1FFFF` | Nextor kernel bank 7                |


## 5. Control Register (0x4104) and Bank Bit Reversal

This is one of the most critical implementation details and a common source of bugs.

### The Register Format

```
  Bit:    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0
        +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
        | S0 | S1 | S2 |  ----- unused --- | EN |
        +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
```

- **EN** (bit 0): IDE registers enable
- **S0, S1, S2** (bits 7, 6, 5): Page number bits (BIT-REVERSED)

### Why Bit Reversal Happens

The Nextor kernel's `chgbnk.mac` routine for the Sunrise IDE driver reverses the bits of the bank number before writing them to the control register. From the Nextor source:

```z80
; Bank selection routine for Sunrise IDE
;   bit 0 of bank → bit 7 of register
;   bit 1 of bank → bit 6 of register
;   bit 2 of bank → bit 5 of register
```

So when Nextor wants to select page 5 (binary `101`):

1. Bank number = `101` (5)
2. Bit-reversed: bit0→bit7, bit1→bit6, bit2→bit5 = `10100000` (`0xA0`)
3. OR with IDE enable: `0xA1`
4. Written to `0x4104`

### How the Hardware Reverses It Back

The real Sunrise hardware (and Carnivore2 VHDL) reverses the bits to form the ROM address:

```vhdl
IDEROMADDR <= cReg(5) & cReg(6) & cReg(7) & Addr(13..0)
```

This means:
- ROM address bit 16 = register bit 5 (= original bank bit 2)
- ROM address bit 15 = register bit 6 (= original bank bit 1)
- ROM address bit 14 = register bit 7 (= original bank bit 0)

### PicoVerse Emulation Code

```c
uint8_t raw = (data >> 5) & 0x07;  // Extract bits [7:5] as 3-bit value
// Reverse 3 bits: {bit2,bit1,bit0} → {bit0,bit1,bit2}
ide->segment = (uint8_t)(((raw & 4) >> 2) | (raw & 2) | ((raw & 1) << 2));
```

The `segment` value (0–7) is then used directly to compute the ROM offset:

```c
uint32_t rel = ((uint32_t)seg << 14) + (addr & 0x3FFFu);
```

## 6. IDE Register Emulation

### Task-File Registers (`0x7E00`–`0x7EFF`)

The IDE registers are mapped at `0x7E00`–`0x7E0F` and mirrored every 16 bytes up to `0x7EFF`. Only the low 4 bits of the address select the register.

| Offset | Read                  | Write                 |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `+0`   | Data (use 0x7C00)    | Data (use 0x7C00)    |
| `+1`   | Error Register        | Feature Register      |
| `+2`   | Sector Count          | Sector Count          |
| `+3`   | Sector Number / LBA[7:0]   | Sector Number / LBA[7:0]   |
| `+4`   | Cylinder Low / LBA[15:8]   | Cylinder Low / LBA[15:8]   |
| `+5`   | Cylinder High / LBA[23:16] | Cylinder High / LBA[23:16] |
| `+6`   | Device/Head           | Device/Head           |
| `+7`   | Status Register       | Command Register      |
| `+E`   | Alternate Status      | Device Control        |

### Status Register Bits

| Bit | Name | Description                |
| --- | ---- | -------------------------- |
| 7   | BSY  | Device is busy             |
| 6   | DRDY | Device is ready            |
| 4   | DSC  | Device seek complete       |
| 3   | DRQ  | Data request (ready for transfer) |
| 0   | ERR  | Error occurred             |

### Error Register Bits

| Bit | Name | Description                     |
| --- | ---- | ------------------------------- |
| 6   | UNC  | Uncorrectable data error        |
| 5   | MC   | Media changed                   |
| 4   | IDNF | ID not found                    |
| 3   | MCR  | Media change requested          |
| 2   | ABRT | Aborted command                 |
| 1   | NM   | No media                        |

### Device/Head Register

```
  Bit:    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0
        +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
        |  1 | LBA|  1 | DEV| HD3| HD2| HD1| HD0|
        +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
```

- **DEV** (bit 4): 0 = master, 1 = slave
- **LBA** (bit 6): 0 = CHS mode, 1 = LBA mode
- **HD[3:0]** (bits 3:0): Head number (CHS) or LBA bits 27:24

### Device Control Register

| Bit | Name  | Description                           |
| --- | ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| 2   | SRST  | Software reset (assert to reset)      |
| 1   | nIEN  | Interrupt enable (0 = enable)         |

## 7. 16-bit Data Register and Byte Latch Mechanism

The IDE data register is inherently 16-bit, but the MSX is an 8-bit system. The Sunrise IDE solves this with a byte-latch mechanism across the `0x7C00`–`0x7DFF` address range:

### Read Operation

1. MSX reads from an **even** address (`addr & 1 == 0`):
   - The emulator fetches a 16-bit word from the sector buffer
   - Returns the **low byte** immediately
   - Latches the **high byte** internally
2. MSX reads from an **odd** address (`addr & 1 == 1`):
   - Returns the previously latched **high byte**
   - Advances the buffer pointer

### Write Operation

1. MSX writes to an **even** address:
   - The byte is latched as the **low byte**
2. MSX writes to an **odd** address:
   - The latched low byte and the current high byte form a 16-bit word
   - The word is stored in the sector buffer
   - If 512 bytes have been received, the sector is committed

### Code Pattern (Nextor driver)

The Nextor driver transfers data using `LDIR` from/to `IDE_DATA` (`0x7C00`):

```z80
ld hl, IDE_DATA     ; 0x7C00
ld de, destination
ld bc, 512
ldir                ; Reads alternate low/high bytes automatically
```

Since `LDIR` increments HL after each byte, the sequence of accesses is:
`0x7C00` (low), `0x7C01` (high), `0x7C02` (low), `0x7C03` (high), ...

## 8. ATA Command Handling

The emulation handles the following ATA commands:

### IDENTIFY DEVICE (0xEC)

- Builds a 512-byte IDENTIFY response with device geometry, model name, serial number, and LBA capacity
- If USB is not mounted yet, sets **BSY** and defers completion until Core 1 sees the USB device mount
- The Nextor driver has a 5-second timeout on `WAIT_DRQ`, giving USB plenty of time to enumerate

### READ SECTORS (0x20)

- **Sector count**: Per the ATA specification, a sector count register value of 0 means **256 sectors** (not zero). Any value 1–255 is taken literally. The `sectors_remaining` field is `uint16_t` to accommodate the 256-sector case.

1. Core 0 sets `usb_read_lba` and `usb_read_requested`, transitions to `IDE_STATE_BUSY`
2. Core 1 picks up the request, issues `tuh_msc_read10()` to the USB device
3. On completion, data is copied to `sector_buffer`, state transitions to `IDE_STATE_READ_DATA` with DRQ set
4. MSX reads 512 bytes through the data register latch mechanism
5. For multi-sector reads, LBA is auto-incremented and the process repeats for up to 256 sectors

### WRITE SECTORS (0x30)

- **Sector count**: Same rule as READ SECTORS — a value of 0 means 256 sectors.

1. Core 0 sets DRQ immediately, transitions to `IDE_STATE_WRITE_DATA`
2. MSX writes 512 bytes through the data register latch mechanism
3. Once 512 bytes are received, the buffer is copied to `usb_write_buffer`
4. Core 1 issues `tuh_msc_write10()` to the USB device
5. On completion, LBA is auto-incremented; if more sectors remain, DRQ is set again

### EXECUTE DEVICE DIAGNOSTIC (0x90)

- Sets the PATA device signature in all registers
- Error register = `0x01` (diagnostic code: no error)
- Sector Count = `0x01`, Sector Number = `0x01`
- Cylinder Low = `0x00`, Cylinder High = `0x00` (PATA signature)
- This is critical for the Nextor `CHKDIAG` routine (see §9)

### DEVICE RESET (0x08)

- Same as EXECUTE DEVICE DIAGNOSTIC for our ATA device

### Software Reset (SRST via Device Control Register)

- **SRST asserted** (bit 2 = 1): Device enters BSY state
- **SRST deasserted** (bit 2 = 0): Device sets the full PATA post-reset signature, including error = `0x01` and cylinder = `0x0000`

### Other Commands

| Command            | Code   | Behavior                    |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------- |
| SET FEATURES       | `0xEF` | Accepted, no action         |
| INITIALIZE DEVICE PARAMETERS | `0x91` | Accepted, no action         |
| RECALIBRATE        | `0x10` | Accepted, no action         |
| Unknown commands   | —      | Status = ERR, Error = ABRT  |

### Slave Device Handling

Any command targeting the slave device (Device/Head register bit 4 = 1) immediately returns ERR + ABRT. The emulation only supports the master device.

## 9. Device Initialization Sequence

Understanding the Nextor Sunrise IDE driver's initialization sequence (`DRV_INIT` in `sunride.asm`) is essential to correct emulation. The sequence proceeds as follows:

### Step 1: Software Reset

```
DRV_INIT (2nd call) →
  IDE_ON (write 0x4104 with bit0=1 to enable IDE) →
  RESET_ALL:
    Select SLAVE → WAIT_BSY
    Select MASTER → WAIT_BSY
    Write M_SRST+M_nIEN to IDE_DEVCTRL  → (our code: BSY)
    Wait ~5µs
    Write M_nIEN to IDE_DEVCTRL          → (our code: sets PATA signature)
    Wait ~2ms
    WAIT_RST (polls BSY for up to 5s)
```

When SRST deasserts, we immediately set the full PATA device signature (status = DRDY|DSC, error = 0x01, cylinder = 0x0000). BSY is already clear.

### Step 2: Execute Device Diagnostic

```
  Write ATACMD.DEVDIAG (0x90) to IDE_CMD
  WAIT_RST (polls BSY for up to 5s)
```

 `ide_set_device_signature()` — error = 0x01, status = DRDY|DSC. BSY is clear immediately.

### Step 3: Check Diagnostics (CHKDIAG)

```
  Read IDE_STATUS → Check M_ERR bit
  If ERR not set → "Initializing: Ok"
  Read IDE_ERROR → Check diagnostic code
    bits[6:0] == 1  → No error (success)
    bits[6:0] == 2  → "formatter device error"
    bits[6:0] == 3  → "sector buffer error"
    bits[6:0] == 4  → "ECC circuitry error"
    bits[6:0] == 5  → "controlling microprocessor error"
    bits[6:0] == 0  → "failed" (no master detected)
    bit 7           → Error flag for slave
```

**Critical**: If we return error = `0x00`, the driver prints `<failed>`. If we return error = `0x04` (ABRT), the driver interprets bits[6:0] = 4 as "ECC circuitry error". Only error = `0x01` means success.

### Step 4: Device Signature Check (GETDEVTYPE)

```
  RESET_ALL.ataonly →
    Select MASTER → WAIT_BSY
    Write SRST → deassert SRST → WAIT_RST
  Read IDE_LBAMID (cylinder low + high as 16-bit value)
    0x0000 → PATA device
    0xEB14 → PATAPI device
    0xC33C → SATA device
    0x9669 → SATAPI device
    0x7F7F / 0xFFFF → Unconnected
```

 After SRST deassert, cylinder_low = 0x00, cylinder_high = 0x00 → driver recognizes a PATA device.

### Step 5: IDENTIFY DEVICE

```
  For PATA: Send ATACMD.IDENTIFY (0xEC) → PIO_CMD → WAIT_DRQ
  Read 512 bytes from IDE_DATA
  Check Word 49 bit 1 (LBA support):
    Set → devtype = LBA (value 2)
    Clear → devtype = CHS (value 1)
```

Build IDENTIFY data with Word 49 = `0x0200` (LBA bit set). If USB is not yet mounted, the device stays BSY and the pending IDENTIFY is completed by Core 1 once USB enumeration finishes. The driver's `WAIT_DRQ` polls for up to 5 seconds.

### Step 6: Device Name Display

The driver prints the model name from IDENTIFY words 27–46, and the firmware revision from words 23–26.

**ATA string byte order**: Each 16-bit word stores the first character of the pair in the **high byte** (bits 15:8) and the second character in the **low byte** (bits 7:0). Our `ata_string_to_words()` helper handles this correctly:

```c
w[i] = ((uint16_t)(uint8_t)src[i * 2] << 8) | (uint8_t)src[i * 2 + 1];
```

The model name is derived from the actual USB device's SCSI INQUIRY response (vendor ID + product ID), so the MSX displays the real name of the connected USB device.

## 10. ATA IDENTIFY DEVICE Response

The 512-byte IDENTIFY DEVICE response is constructed in `build_identify_data()`:

| Word(s)  | Field                         | Value                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 0        | General configuration         | `0x0040` (fixed device, non-removable)          |
| 1        | Cylinders                     | Computed from USB block count (max 16383)       |

The CHS geometry is a synthetic translation for compatibility. The Nextor driver uses LBA mode exclusively after detecting the LBA capability flag.

## 11. USB Mass Storage Integration

### TinyUSB Host Stack

The USB subsystem uses TinyUSB in host mode with the Mass Storage Class (MSC) driver:

- **Configuration**: `tusb_config.h` sets `CFG_TUSB_RHPORT0_MODE = OPT_MODE_HOST`
- **MSC enabled**: `CFG_TUH_MSC = 1`
- **Hub support**: `CFG_TUH_HUB = 1` (supports USB hubs with up to 4 downstream devices)
- **Buffer alignment**: All I/O buffers are 4-byte aligned for DMA (`TU_ATTR_ALIGNED(4)`)

### Device Enumeration

1. USB device is plugged into the RP2040's USB-C port
2. TinyUSB enumerates the device and calls `tuh_msc_mount_cb()`
3. A SCSI INQUIRY command is sent to retrieve vendor/product information
4. On INQUIRY completion, block count and block size are obtained via `tuh_msc_get_block_count()` / `tuh_msc_get_block_size()`
5. `usb_device_mounted` is set to `true`

### Block I/O

- **Read**: `tuh_msc_read10(dev_addr, lun, buffer, lba, 1, callback, 0)`
- **Write**: `tuh_msc_write10(dev_addr, lun, buffer, lba, 1, callback, 0)`
- Transfers are single-sector (512 bytes) due to the ATA↔USB bridge design
- Completion is asynchronous via callbacks (`read_complete_cb`, `write_complete_cb`)

### Error Handling

- LBA out of range → `usb_read_failed` / `usb_write_failed` flags
- Transfer failure (CSW status ≠ 0) → error flags set
- Core 0 translates these into ATA error responses (ERR status + ABRT error)

### Hot-Plug

When a USB device is removed, `tuh_msc_umount_cb()` clears all state. Subsequent ATA commands return ERR + ABRT until a new device is mounted because `usb_device_mounted` will be `false`.

## 12. Dual-Core Design

### Core 0: PIO Bus Engine + IDE Logic

Core 0 runs the main event loop in `loadrom_sunrise()`:

```
while (true) {
    poll loop:
        drain pending writes from SM1 FIFO      ← continuous!
        if SM0 read FIFO non-empty:
            get address, break
    drain any remaining writes
    if address in 0x4000-0x7FFF:
        if sunrise_ide_handle_read() intercepts → return IDE data
        else → return ROM data (page selected by ide.segment)
    else:
        return 0xFF (tri-state)
    respond via SM0 TX FIFO
}
```

**Critical: write FIFO draining must be continuous.** Unlike other mapper types where bank switches involve 1–2 writes between reads, the Sunrise IDE requires bursts of 8–9 writes for each ATA command (bank switch + IDE enable + 6 task-file registers + command). The PIO write SM FIFO is 8 entries deep (joined). If writes are only drained around blocking read calls, the FIFO can overflow during ATA command setup. The PIO write SM stalls on its `push block` instruction when full, silently missing any writes that occur while stalled. This causes lost command or LBA register writes, leading to data corruption.

### Core 1: USB Host Stack

Core 1 runs `sunrise_usb_task()`:

```
tusb_init()
tuh_init(0)
while (true) {
    tuh_task()                    // Process USB events
    service read requests         // tuh_msc_read10
    service write requests        // tuh_msc_write10
    propagate completion to IDE   // Update status/state/buffers
    complete pending IDENTIFY     // If USB just mounted
}
```

### Inter-Core Communication

The two cores communicate through the shared `sunrise_ide_t` structure. All shared fields are declared `volatile`:

| Direction       | Mechanism                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Core 0 → Core 1 | `usb_read_requested`, `usb_write_requested`, `usb_read_lba`, `usb_write_lba` |
| Core 1 → Core 0 | `usb_read_ready`, `usb_read_failed`, `usb_write_ready`, `usb_write_failed` |
| Core 1 → Core 0 | `status`, `error`, `state`, `buffer_index`, `buffer_length` |
| Core 1 → Core 0 | `sector_buffer[]` contents (after read completion) |
| Core 0 → Core 1 | `usb_identify_pending` |

The communication is safe because:
- Flag transitions are unidirectional (one core sets, the other clears)
- Buffer ownership follows the state machine (Core 0 owns the buffer during DRQ states, Core 1 owns it during BSY)
- The RP2040's memory model provides coherent access between cores for volatile variables

## 13. Nextor ROM Embedding

The Nextor 2.1.4 Sunrise IDE (Master Only) ROM is embedded directly in the loadrom tool binary:

- **Source file**: `nextor_sunrise.h` (generated via `xxd` from the ROM file)
- **ROM file**: `Nextor-2.1.4.SunriseIDE.MasterOnly.ROM`
- **Size**: 131,072 bytes (128 KB, exactly 8 × 16 KB pages)
- **ROM type**: 10 (`ROM_TYPE_SUNRISE`)

The tool creates a UF2 file with a configuration record containing:
- ROM name: `"Nextor Sunrise IDE"` (up to 50 chars, padded)
- ROM type: `10`
- ROM size: `131072`
- ROM data: The full 128 KB ROM

The firmware's `main()` reads the rom_type byte and dispatches to `loadrom_sunrise()` when type = 10.

## 14. LoadROM Tool Usage

### Building a Sunrise IDE UF2

```bash
loadrom -s
```

Or with a custom output filename:

```bash
loadrom -s -o my_nextor.uf2
```

The `-s` / `--sunrise` flag tells the tool to use the embedded Nextor Sunrise ROM. No external ROM file is needed or accepted.

### Output

```
ROM Type: Sunrise [Embedded]
ROM Name: Nextor Sunrise IDE
ROM Size: 131072 bytes
Pico Offset: 0x00000037
UF2 Output: loadrom.uf2
```

### Flashing

1. Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico and connect USB
2. Copy `loadrom.uf2` to the RPI-RP2 drive
3. Connect a USB mass storage device to the Pico's USB-C port
4. Insert the PicoVerse cartridge into the MSX and power on


## 15. Build Configuration

### CMakeLists.txt

The Sunrise IDE build requires these additional dependencies compared to the base loadrom:

```cmake
add_executable(loadrom
    ${PICO_SDK_PATH}/lib/tinyusb/src/tusb.c
    loadrom.c
    sunrise_ide.c)

target_link_libraries(loadrom
    pico_stdlib
    pico_multicore      # For multicore_launch_core1
    hardware_dma
    hardware_pio
    tinyusb_board       # Board support for TinyUSB
    tinyusb_host)       # USB host stack
```

### TinyUSB Configuration (`tusb_config.h`)
